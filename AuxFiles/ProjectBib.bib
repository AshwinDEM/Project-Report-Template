abstract = {Face recognition has a wide range of applications like video surveillance, security, access control, etc. Over the past decade, the field of face recognition has matured and grown at par with the latest advancements in technology, particularly deep learning. Convolution Neural Networks have surpassed human accuracy in Face Recognition on popular evaluation tests such as LFW. However, most existing models evaluate their performance with an assumption of the availability of full facial information. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid forth challenges to this assumption, and to the performance of existing methods and leading-edge algorithms in the field of face recognition. This is in the wake of an explosive increase in the number of people wearing face masks. The reduced amount of facial information available to a recognition system from a masked face impacts their discrimination ability. In this context, we design and conduct a series of experiments comparing the masked face recognition performances of CNN architectures available in literature and exploring possible alterations in loss functions, architectures, and training methods that can enable existing methods to fully extract and leverage the limited facial information available in a masked face. We evaluate existing CNN-based face recognition systems for their performance against datasets composed entirely of masked faces, in contrast to the existing standard evaluations where masked or occluded faces are a rare occurrence. The study also presents evidence denoting an increased impact of network depth on performance compared to standard face recognition. Our observations indicate that substantial performance gains can be achieved by the introduction of masked faces in the training set. The study also inferred that various parameter settings determined suitable for standard face recognition are not ideal for masked face recognition. Through empirical analysis we derived new value recommendations for these parameters and settings.}

abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms for facial expression recognition and patient monitoring is a growing area of research interest. In this study, we present a technique for facial expression recognition based on deep learning algorithm: convolutional neural network (ConvNet). Data were collected from the FER2013 dataset that contains samples of seven universal facial expressions for training. The results show that the presented technique improves facial expression recognition accuracy without encoding several layers of CNN that lead to a computationally costly model. This study proffers solutions to the issues of high computational cost due to the implementation of facial expression recognition by providing a model close to the accuracy of the state-of-the-art model. The study concludes that deep l\earning-enabled facial expression recognition techniques enhance accuracy, better facial recognition, and interpretation of facial expressions and features that promote efficiency and prediction in the health sector.},

abstract = {Face recognition is a relatively common method humans use to confirm their identity. Protecting the safe transmission of face images has become a hot issue. This paper proposes an encryption method for face images, EFR-CSTP. The EFR-CSTP is very efficient because it only encrypts the facial in the face image. Firstly, the secret keys are generated by Hash. They are the parameters and the initial values of the two-dimensional logistic tent modular map (2D-LTMM), the chaotic sequence required for encryption by 2D-LTMM. Secondly, facial information is recognized by the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). Note that the entire algorithm only encrypts this facial image. Finally, the facial image is used as the input of the EFR-CSTP, and the ciphertext image is generated by scrambling, STP combined with the XOR diffusion method. We evaluated our algorithm in the IMDB-WIKI dataset. We also evaluate the EFR-CSTP and other algorithms on the same datasets. The evaluation results show that the EFR-CSTP has excellent performance and efficiency.}

  abstract = {The global epidemic of COVID-19 makes people realize that wearing a mask is one of the most effective ways to protect ourselves from virus infections, which poses serious challenges for the existing face recognition system. To tackle the difficulties, a new method for masked face recognition is proposed by integrating a cropping-based approach with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). The optimal cropping is explored for each case, while the CBAM module is adopted to focus on the regions around eyes. Two special application scenarios, using faces without mask for training to recognize masked faces, and using masked faces for training to recognize faces without mask, have also been studied. Comprehensive experiments on SMFRD, CISIA-Webface, AR and Extend Yela B datasets show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of masked face recognition compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.},

For authenticating the user, the smart card is positioned onto a reader/writer, the stored file of the encrypted biometric template is retrieved, and then the identity verification process starts with placing the user's biometric feature on the scanner.

Once these things are plugged into the network, more and more smart processes and services are possible which can support our economies, environment and health. On the other hand, Air transport has become one of the essential elements of globalization. Its development has been exponential for decades, following the technological advances of aviation on one side, and the propensity of men to move on the other. With rapidly increasing traffic, the current logistics and infrastructure models of airports must inevitably evolve in order to adapt quickly and sustainably. To make the passenger journey more fluid, airports are increasingly using new technologies. In this paper, we propose an airport management system based on the IoT paradigm, where passengers, baggage, plane or the departure lounge are considered as "things". Our smart airport management system aims to automate passengers processing and flight management steps, in order to improve services, facilitate airport agents' tasks and offer passengers a pleasant and safe journey.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of facial recognition technologies (FRT) has led to complex ethical choices in terms of balancing individual privacy rights versus delivering societal safety. Within this space, increasingly commonplace use of these technologies by law enforcement agencies has presented a particular lens for probing this complex landscape, its application, and the acceptable extent of citizen surveillance. This analysis focuses on the regulatory contexts and recent case law in the United States (USA), United Kingdom (UK), and European Union (EU) in terms of the use and misuse of FRT by law enforcement agencies. In the case of the USA, it is one of the main global regions in which the technology is being rapidly evolved, and yet, it has a patchwork of legislation with less emphasis on data protection and privacy. Within the context of the EU and the UK, there has been a critical focus on the development of accountability requirements particularly when considered in the context of the EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the legal focus on Privacy by Design (PbD). However, globally, there is no standardised human rights framework and regulatory requirements that can be easily applied to FRT rollout. This article contains a discursive discussion considering the complexity of the ethical and regulatory dimensions at play in these spaces including considering data protection and human rights frameworks. It concludes that data protection impact assessments (DPIA) and human rights impact assessments together with greater transparency, regulation, audit and explanation of FRT use, and application in individual contexts would improve FRT deployments. In addition, it sets out ten critical questions which it suggests need to be answered for the successful development and deployment of FRT and AI more broadly. It is suggested that these should be answered by lawmakers, policy makers, AI developers, and adopters.},
