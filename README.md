# AIML EL Report Template

This project template exists only because the original upstream repo has things that seem overkill for a simple EL report, such as the extra page for each chapter, QR Code, background images, etc. \
If you are to use a template for presentations that are deemed important enough to use those features, please use the original repo. \
There is no special reason that the front page looks like that, it just consists of the most common front page information across all my reports. \
Every page also has borders since teachers in AIML prefer borders.

## Usage
If you are a beginner, or you want to use this to simply make your EL reports with peace and calm, use overleaf. It simplifies the process greatly, and allows collaboration.
Download the whole repo as a zip file, and upload it to overleaf, through `New Project` -> `Upload Project`.
